# Emissions for Activities
#
# People breath at different rates doing different activites. Infected people
# also emit different volumes of virus particles and the size of the droplets of
# spittle change (changing the relative rate of aerosol and fomite emissions).
#
# We model this based on the type of worker and the room they are in and
# potentially based on other characteristics (e.g. the number of people in a
# gathering). For example, a worker sitting at their desk is assumed to be
# *breathing*, but a worker in a meeting room is either *breathing* or
# *speaking*, and the relative amount of time they do each is determined by the
# number of people in the meeting.
