# Workplaces

Various workplaces we have developed in various projects. In each subfolder there are various data
and code files that describe various aspects of the workplace and the behaviour of the agents that
use it. The manner of specification of each workplace is different and hence each folder contains a
different set of files, though they share some in common.
